# Luisa - Framework (former vue-low-code)
The Luisa framework is an open-source project that turns [Figma](https://figma.com) and [Quant-UX](https://quant-ux.com)
designs into fully functional *VUE3* applications. By ensuring that the
design stays the single source of truth, Vue-Low-Code reduces the need for design
hand-offs and front-end code significantly.
